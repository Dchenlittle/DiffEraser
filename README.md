# DiffEraser: Generalized Text Erasure Based on Latent Diffusion Prior
First, the conventional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) encoder is replaced with a Diffusion-Prior (DP) encoder, through which the heterogeneous information from the LDM prior knowledge in latent space is integrated with the multi-level encoded features of the input image.
Second, a Latent-Fusion (LF) decoder is introduced, by which the heterogeneous features from both the LDM and DP encoders are integrated to generate high-quality text-erased results.
